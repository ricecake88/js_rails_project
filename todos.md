Small Stretch Goals
```
  [] implement a method to make sure the record for "yesterday" is marked off, in order to figure out streak number
  [] integrate streak level (easy, medium, hard) to habit
  [] figure out a way to display when a habit has hit the goal of a streak level
  [] "tab" between Modify/View/Add (?)
  [] Change color upon selecting color in modify, as opposed to clicking away from select
```

Medium Stretch Goals
```
[x] Deploy on the web
[] Invalidate token after a certain time
```

Distant Stretch goals
```
[] intergrate productivity timer/pomodoro timer where one can set a timer to a habit (if they wish) as an option
```

Bug Fixes
```
[x] Modify Habit.all to be based on user habits, not all habits. This causes an issue when deleting a habit. Upon refreshing it displays correctly.
[] Render habit summary section based on user habits, not all habits.
[] Fix HabitRecords.all so they only belong to a specific habit. Inefficient, time intensive the more records there are.
[] Associate Habit Records with a Habit
```

Testing
```
[] Add testing framework
```
